ðŸŽ¨ MoodColor is an AI-powered mood tracking tool that transforms your daily experiencesâ€”whether in text or photosâ€”into a color that represents your current emotional state. Whether you're capturing joy, peace, or subtle melancholy, the system analyzes your input and assigns a HEX color code to visually express how you feel.

Users can maintain a daily mood journal through a calendar-like dashboard, upload content, and reflect on their emotional journey. The platform not only creates mood-based icons and themed pages but also supports collaborationâ€”allowing friends or teams to co-create and share their emotional color stories.

This project aims to bring emotional awareness and a touch of healing by helping users visualize their feelings in color. Ideal for personal reflection, mood tracking, or simply expressing your day through design.

Built with modern technologies and supports extensibility via AI, containerized infrastructure, and modular event-driven architecture.
